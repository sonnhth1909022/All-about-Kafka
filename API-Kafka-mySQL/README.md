This is the first project about kafka.
API used in this project is data.py and it is fake data generating every 5s after program is started
Producer get data and send it to topic and kafka server will distribute messages between partitions
Consumer get data from partitions
Consumer store data into mySQL server (database and table)
* This process repeats until it finished writing 1000 records or all programs are stopped.
* server.log is used to store data generated by the file data.py
